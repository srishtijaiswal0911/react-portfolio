                Hi there! I'm an Computer Science Grad Student at UF eager to secure challenging internship roles that require me to learn new technologies. Through my B.Tech at The SRM University, India, I gained hands-on experience in software development and machine learning, honing my skills and proficiency in the field. I've had the opportunity to work for about 2 years, starting as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant and later as a Risk and Financial Advisory Analyst at Deloitte.

                But that's not all there is to me! I have a deep passion for classical singing, and I love to blend beautiful melodies with the world of technology. My goal is to apply my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and industry knowledge to create innovative solutions. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Working to bring a positive impact on the world - one code at a time!
